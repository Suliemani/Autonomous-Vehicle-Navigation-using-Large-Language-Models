# Autonomous Vehicle Navigation Using Large Language Models

## Overview
This project presents an AI-driven navigation system for autonomous vehicles developed in the CARLA simulator. It leverages Large Language Models to interpret natural language user commands and generate optimized navigation routes in real time.

## Key Features
- Natural language command understanding
- Integration with CARLA simulator
- Real-time route planning
- Collision avoidance using multiple detection methods
- Comparative evaluation of multiple LLMs

## Models Evaluated
